Google Sheets is the most popular destination for Redbark Sync. Transactions are appended as rows to a sheet (tab) within a spreadsheet you choose.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Google account">
    Click **Add Destination**, select **Google Sheets**, and sign in with Google. Redbark Sync will request permission to access your spreadsheets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a spreadsheet">
    Choose which Google Sheets spreadsheet to use from the list of spreadsheets in your Google Drive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a sheet">
    Pick the sheet (tab) within the spreadsheet where transactions will be written. If your spreadsheet only has one sheet, it will be selected automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

On each sync, Redbark Sync:

1. **Checks for headers** — if the first row is empty, column headers are created automatically
2. **Reads existing Transaction IDs** — column A is scanned to identify transactions that have already been synced
3. **Appends new rows** — only new transactions are appended to the bottom of the sheet

## Column format

Transactions are written as rows with the following columns:

| Column | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A — Transaction ID | Text | Unique identifier used for deduplication |
| B — Date | Date | Transaction date |
| C — Description | Text | Transaction description |
| D — Amount | Number | Transaction amount |
| E — Direction | Text | `credit` or `debit` |
| F — Balance | Number | Account balance after transaction |
| G — Category | Text | Transaction category (if available) |
| H — Merchant | Text | Merchant name (if available) |
| I — Account | Text | Bank account name |
| J — Status | Text | `posted` or `pending` |
| K — Class | Text | `payment`, `transfer`, `fee`, `interest`, or `other` |
| L — Post Date | Date | Date the transaction was posted |

<Tip>
  You can safely add your own columns to the right of column L — they won't be affected by syncs.

## Authentication

Google Sheets uses OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens. Your access token is refreshed automatically before each sync. If your Google session is revoked, you'll need to re-authenticate from the [destinations](/destinations) page.

## Tips

- **One sheet per sync** — each sync writes to a single sheet. Create multiple syncs if you want different accounts in different sheets.
- **Formulas are safe** — syncs only append rows and never modify existing data, so your formulas, charts, and formatting are preserved.
- **Shared spreadsheets** — you can share the spreadsheet with others. Only the Google account used to connect needs to grant access to Redbark Sync.
