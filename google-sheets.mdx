Google Sheets is the most popular destination for Redbark Sync. It supports all three sync types — transactions, holdings, and trades — each written to a sheet (tab) within a spreadsheet you choose.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Google account">
    Click **Add Destination**, select **Google Sheets**, and sign in with Google. Redbark Sync will request permission to access your spreadsheets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a spreadsheet">
    Choose which Google Sheets spreadsheet to use from the list of spreadsheets in your Google Drive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a sheet">
    Pick the sheet (tab) within the spreadsheet where data will be written. If your spreadsheet only has one sheet, it will be selected automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

The sync behaviour depends on the type of sync:

### Transactions (banking)

On each sync, Redbark Sync:

1. **Checks for headers** — if the first row is empty, column headers are created automatically
2. **Reads existing Transaction IDs** — column A is scanned to identify transactions that have already been synced
3. **Appends new rows** — only new transactions are appended to the bottom of the sheet

### Holdings (brokerage)

On each sync, Redbark Sync:

1. **Writes headers** — column headers are written to the first row
2. **Replaces all data** — the entire sheet is overwritten with a fresh snapshot of your portfolio

<Info>
  Holdings syncs replace all existing data in the sheet. Use a dedicated sheet for holdings to avoid losing other data.

### Trades (brokerage)

On each sync, Redbark Sync:

1. **Checks for headers** — if the first row is empty, column headers are created automatically
2. **Reads existing Trade IDs** — column A is scanned to identify trades that have already been synced
3. **Appends new rows** — only new trades are appended to the bottom of the sheet

<Tip>
  You can safely add your own columns to the right of the last data column — they won't be affected by syncs. For holdings sheets, keep additional data in separate sheets since the data is replaced on each sync.

## Authentication

Google Sheets uses OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens. Your access token is refreshed automatically before each sync. If your Google session is revoked, you'll need to re-authenticate from the [destinations](/destinations) page.

## Tips

- **One sheet per sync** — each sync writes to a single sheet. Create multiple syncs if you want different accounts or data types in different sheets.
- **Formulas are safe** — transaction and trade syncs only append rows and never modify existing data, so your formulas, charts, and formatting are preserved.
- **Shared spreadsheets** — you can share the spreadsheet with others. Only the Google account used to connect needs to grant access to Redbark Sync.
- **Separate holdings sheets** — since holdings syncs replace all data, use a dedicated sheet for holdings and keep your analysis in a separate sheet that references it.
