description: "Sync transactions to an Airtable base"
---

Airtable lets you sync transactions into a structured table within a base, giving you access to Airtable's filtering, grouping, and visualisation features.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Airtable account">
    Click **Add Destination**, select **Airtable**, and sign in. Redbark Sync uses OAuth with PKCE to securely connect to your Airtable workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a base">
    Choose the Airtable base where transactions should be stored.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a table">
    Pick the table within the base. You can use an existing table or create a new one beforehand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

On each sync, Redbark Sync:

1. **Ensures fields exist** — any missing fields are created automatically using the Airtable Meta API
2. **Reads existing Transaction IDs** — the "Transaction ID" field is queried to identify transactions that have already been synced
3. **Creates new records** — only new transactions are inserted as records, in batches of 10 (Airtable's API limit)

## Field schema

The following fields are created in your table:

| Field | Airtable Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction ID | Single line text | Unique identifier used for deduplication |
| Date | Date | Transaction date |
| Description | Single line text | Transaction description |
| Amount | Number | Transaction amount |
| Direction | Single select | `credit` or `debit` |
| Balance | Number | Account balance after transaction |
| Category | Single line text | Transaction category (if available) |
| Merchant | Single line text | Merchant name (if available) |
| Account | Single line text | Bank account name |
| Status | Single line text | `posted` or `pending` |
| Class | Single line text | `payment`, `transfer`, `fee`, `interest`, or `other` |
| Post Date | Date | Date the transaction was posted |

<Info>
  Fields are only created if they don't already exist. If you've pre-created fields with matching names, Redbark Sync will use them as-is.

## Authentication

Airtable uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. Access tokens are refreshed automatically before each sync. If your Airtable session is revoked, you'll need to re-authenticate from the [destinations](/destinations) page.

## Tips

- **Views and filters** — create custom Airtable views to filter transactions by category, date range, or account.
- **Automations** — use Airtable's built-in automations to trigger workflows when new transactions are synced (e.g. send a Slack notification for large transactions).
- **Existing tables** — you can point Redbark Sync at an existing table. Missing fields will be added automatically without affecting your existing data.
