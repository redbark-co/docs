A CDR consent is a time-limited agreement that allows Redbark Sync to access your banking data. Each consent is tied to a specific bank and expires after 12 months.

<Info>
  CDR consents apply to **Australian bank connections** only. New Zealand bank connections use Akahu's OAuth model, and brokerage connections use SnapTrade's connection flow — neither requires a separate consent management step.

## Consent cards

Each consent shows:

- **Bank name** and status icon
- **Purpose** — what the data is used for (e.g. "Transaction sync")
- **Status badge** — Active, Expired, or Withdrawn
- **Data shared** — the types of data included (e.g. Transactions, Accounts, Balances)
- **Created date** and **expiry date**

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Active** | Consent is valid and data can be accessed |
| **Expired** | The 12-month consent period has ended |
| **Withdrawn** | You have revoked the consent |

## Expiring consents

Consents last 12 months from the date they were created. A warning badge appears when a consent is within 30 days of expiring. Once expired, syncs using that bank connection will stop running.

## Withdrawing consent

Click **Withdraw Consent** on an active consent to revoke data access immediately. This will disable any syncs that use the associated bank connection. Data that has already been synced to your destinations is not deleted.

## Re-consenting

To restore access after a consent expires or is withdrawn, add a new bank connection from the [connections](/connections) page. This will create a fresh 12-month consent.

## Other connection types

New Zealand bank connections (Akahu) and brokerage connections (SnapTrade) do not use CDR consents. To revoke access for these connections, delete the connection from the [connections](/connections) page or revoke access directly through your bank or brokerage.
