A destination is a specific sheet within a Google Sheets spreadsheet where transactions are written.

## Destinations list

Each destination card shows the spreadsheet name, sheet name, and a link to open it directly in Google Sheets.

## Adding a destination

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your Google account">
    Click **Add Destination** and sign in with Google to grant Redbark Sync access to your spreadsheets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a spreadsheet">
    Choose which Google Sheets spreadsheet to use.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a sheet">
    Pick the sheet (tab) within the spreadsheet where transactions will be written.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Column format

Transactions are written with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Date | Transaction date |
| Description | Transaction description |
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Balance | Account balance after transaction |
| Category | Transaction category (if available) |
| Account | Bank account name |

<Tip>
  New rows are appended to the bottom of the sheet. You can safely add your own columns to the right — they won't be affected by syncs.
</Tip>

## Removing a destination

Select **Delete** from the three-dot menu on a destination card. Any syncs using this destination will also be deleted.
