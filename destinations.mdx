A destination is a specific location — a Google Sheets spreadsheet, an Airtable base, or a Notion database — where your bank or brokerage data is written.

You can connect multiple destinations and create separate syncs for each, allowing you to send different accounts to different places.

## Supported destinations

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Google Sheets" icon="table" href="/google-sheets">

  </Card>
</Columns>

<Info>
  Google Sheets supports all sync types — transactions, holdings, and trades. Airtable and Notion currently support transaction syncs only.

## Destinations list

Each destination card shows:

- **Destination type** icon (Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion)
- **Name** — the spreadsheet, base, or database name
- **Subtitle** — the specific sheet, table, or database within
- **Open** button — link to open the destination directly in its app

  <Step title="Choose a type">
    Click **Add Destination** and select Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data fields by sync type

### Transaction fields

All destinations receive the same set of transaction fields, formatted appropriately for each platform:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction ID | Unique identifier used for deduplication |
| Date | Transaction date |
| Description | Transaction description |
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Direction | Credit or debit |
| Balance | Account balance after transaction |
| Category | Transaction category (if available) |
| Merchant | Merchant name (if available) |
| Account | Bank account name |
| Status | Posted or pending |
| Class | Payment, transfer, fee, interest, or other |
| Post Date | Date the transaction was posted |

### Holdings fields (Google Sheets only)

Holdings syncs write a full portfolio snapshot on each run:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Symbol | Stock ticker or symbol |
| Name | Company or asset name |
| Quantity | Number of shares held |
| Avg Price | Average purchase price per share |
| Current Price | Current market price |
| Market Value | Total current value |
| P&L | Unrealised profit or loss |
| Currency | Currency code (e.g. USD) |
| Exchange | Stock exchange code |
| Last Updated | When the data was last synced |

### Trade fields (Google Sheets only)

Trade syncs append new trades with deduplication:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Trade ID | Unique identifier used for deduplication |
| Date | Trade execution date |
| Symbol | Stock ticker or symbol |
| Type | Buy, sell, dividend, split, transfer, fee, interest, or other |
| Quantity | Number of shares traded |
| Price | Price per share |
| Total | Total transaction amount |
| Fees | Trading or commission fees |
| Currency | Currency code (e.g. USD) |
| Account | Brokerage account name |
| Description | Additional trade description |
| Settlement Date | Settlement date (if available) |

<Tip>
  Transactions and trades are deduplicated using their respective IDs. Re-running a sync will not create duplicate entries. Holdings are replaced entirely on each sync.
</Tip>

## Removing a destination

Select **Delete** from the three-dot menu on a destination card. Any syncs using this destination will also be deleted.
