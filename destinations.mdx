A destination is a specific location — a Google Sheets spreadsheet, an Airtable base, or a Notion database — where your bank transactions are written.

You can connect multiple destinations and create separate syncs for each, allowing you to send different accounts to different places.

## Supported destinations

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Google Sheets" icon="table" href="/google-sheets">
    Sync transactions to a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Airtable" icon="grid-2" href="/airtable">
    Sync transactions to a table in an Airtable base.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notion" icon="book" href="/notion">
    Sync transactions to a database in Notion.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Destinations list

Each destination card shows:

- **Destination type** icon (Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion)
- **Name** — the spreadsheet, base, or database name
- **Subtitle** — the specific sheet, table, or database within
- **Open** button — link to open the destination directly in its app

## Adding a destination

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a type">
    Click **Add Destination** and select Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Sign in with your account for the chosen service. Redbark Sync will request permission to read and write data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a target">
    Pick the specific resource to write transactions to:

    - **Google Sheets** — choose a spreadsheet, then a sheet (tab)
    - **Airtable** — choose a base, then a table
    - **Notion** — choose a database
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Transaction fields

All destinations receive the same set of transaction fields, formatted appropriately for each platform:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction ID | Unique identifier used for deduplication |
| Date | Transaction date |
| Description | Transaction description |
| Amount | Transaction amount |
| Direction | Credit or debit |
| Balance | Account balance after transaction |
| Category | Transaction category (if available) |
| Merchant | Merchant name (if available) |
| Account | Bank account name |
| Status | Posted or pending |
| Class | Payment, transfer, fee, interest, or other |
| Post Date | Date the transaction was posted |

<Tip>
  Transactions are deduplicated using the Transaction ID. Re-running a sync will not create duplicate entries.
</Tip>

## Removing a destination

Select **Delete** from the three-dot menu on a destination card. Any syncs using this destination will also be deleted.
