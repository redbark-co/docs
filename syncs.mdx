---

A sync links one account to one destination. Data flows from your bank or brokerage into the destination automatically.

## Sync types

The type of sync depends on the connection category:

| Sync type | Source | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transactions** | Banking (AU/NZ) | New transactions are appended. Existing ones are skipped using the Transaction ID for deduplication. |
| **Holdings** | Brokerage | A full snapshot of your portfolio replaces the previous data on each sync. |
| **Trades** | Brokerage | New trades are appended. Existing ones are skipped using the Trade ID for deduplication. |

<Info>
  Holdings syncs replace all data on each run to give you an up-to-date portfolio snapshot. Transaction and trade syncs are append-only — they never modify existing records.
</Info>

## Sync list

The syncs page shows a card for each sync with:

- **Source** — the bank or brokerage account (institution logo, account name, masked number)
- **Destination** — the destination name and type (Google Sheets, Airtable, or Notion)
- **Sync type** — Transactions, Holdings, or Trades
- **Status** — current sync state
- **Last activity** — how long ago the last sync ran

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Active** | Sync is enabled and running on schedule |
| **Inactive** | Sync is disabled — automatic syncs won't run |
| **Syncing** | A sync is currently in progress |

## Sync detail page

Click **Details** on any sync card to open its detail page. You'll see four information cards:

- **Source** — institution, account name and number, connection status
- **Destination** — destination name and type, with a link to open in the destination app
- **Status** — whether the sync is active and the result of the last run
- **Timeline** — when the sync was created and when it last ran

### Settings

From the detail page you can:

- **Toggle sync on/off** — disable automatic syncs without deleting the sync
- **Change destination** — switch which destination the sync writes to
- **Delete sync** — permanently remove the sync

## Manual sync

Click **Sync Now** on a sync's detail page to trigger an immediate sync. The button is disabled while the sync is inactive.

## Creating a new sync

Click **Add Sync** from the syncs page. You'll need at least one [connection](/connections) and one [destination](/destinations) before you can create a sync.

When creating a sync from a brokerage connection, you'll choose the sync type — **Holdings** or **Trades**. Banking connections automatically create a transaction sync.
