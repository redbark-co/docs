A sync links one bank account to one Google Sheet. Transactions flow from your bank into the spreadsheet automatically each day.

## Sync list

The syncs page shows a card for each sync with:

- **Source** — the bank account (institution logo, account name, masked number)
- **Destination** — the Google Sheets spreadsheet and sheet name
- **Status** — current sync state
- **Last activity** — how long ago the last sync ran

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Active** | Sync is enabled and running on schedule |
| **Inactive** | Sync is disabled — automatic syncs won't run |
| **Syncing** | A sync is currently in progress |

## Sync detail page

Click **Details** on any sync card to open its detail page. You'll see four information cards:

- **Source** — institution, account name and number, connection status
- **Destination** — spreadsheet and sheet name, with a link to open in Google Sheets
- **Status** — whether the sync is active and the result of the last run
- **Timeline** — when the sync was created and when it last ran

### Settings

From the detail page you can:

- **Toggle sync on/off** — disable automatic syncs without deleting the sync
- **Change destination** — switch which spreadsheet the sync writes to
- **Delete sync** — permanently remove the sync

## Manual sync

Click **Sync Now** on a sync's detail page to trigger an immediate sync. The button is disabled while the sync is inactive.

## Creating a new sync

Click **Add Sync** from the syncs page. You'll need at least one [connection](/connections) and one [destination](/destinations) before you can create a sync.
