A run is the execution record for a single sync — either a scheduled daily sync or a manual one triggered from the dashboard.

## Runs table

The runs page shows a table with 25 runs per page:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Run result with a coloured dot indicator |
| Source | Bank account with institution logo and masked number |
| Destination | Spreadsheet and sheet name |
| Transactions | Number of new transactions written (e.g. "+5 new") |
| Duration | How long the sync took |
| Date | When the run started |

## Statuses

| Status | Colour | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syncing** | Blue | Sync is currently running |
| **Success** | Green | Sync completed and transactions were written |
| **Failed** | Red | Sync encountered an error |

## Failed runs

Common causes of a failed run:

- **Expired Google OAuth** — re-connect your Google account from the [destinations](/destinations) page
- **Invalidated bank connection** — your bank credentials have changed; reconnect from the [connections](/connections) page
- **Expired CDR consent** — the 12-month consent period has ended; re-consent from the [consents](/consents) page

The error message for a failed run is shown in the table row. Hover over truncated messages to see the full text.
