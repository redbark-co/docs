A run is the execution record for a single sync — either triggered automatically or manually from the dashboard.

## Runs table

The runs page shows a table with 25 runs per page:

| Destination | Destination name and type |
| Records | Number of new records written (e.g. "+5 new") |
| Duration | How long the sync took |

## Statuses

| Status | Colour | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syncing** | Blue | Sync is currently running |
| **Success** | Green | Sync completed and records were written |
| **Failed** | Red | Sync encountered an error |

- **Expired destination OAuth** — re-connect your account from the [destinations](/destinations) page
- **Invalidated bank connection** — your bank credentials have changed; reconnect from the [connections](/connections) page
- **Expired CDR consent** — the 12-month consent period has ended (Australian banks only); re-consent from the [consents](/consents) page
- **Revoked Akahu token** — your NZ bank access was revoked; reconnect from the [connections](/connections) page
