## Set up your first sync

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect an account">
    Click **Add Connection** and choose your provider:

    - **Australian bank** — opens the Fiskil consent flow. Select your bank and log in via Australia's Consumer Data Right.
    - **New Zealand bank** — opens the Akahu OAuth flow. Log in and authorise access.
    - **Brokerage** — opens the SnapTrade connection portal. Link your brokerage account.

    Your credentials are handled securely by each provider and are never stored on Redbark servers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an account">
    Once connected, your accounts sync automatically. Choose the account you want to sync — you'll see the account name, type, and current balance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a destination">
    Click **Add Destination** and choose where to send your data:

    - **[Google Sheets](/google-sheets)** — sync to a spreadsheet (supports transactions, holdings, and trades)
    - **[Airtable](/airtable)** — sync to an Airtable base (transactions)
    - **[Notion](/notion)** — sync to a Notion database (transactions)

    Sign in with your account to grant Redbark Sync access, then select the specific spreadsheet, base, or database to write to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review data fields">
    The data synced depends on the type of sync:

    - **Transactions** (banking) — 12 fields including date, amount, description, category, and merchant
    - **Holdings** (brokerage) — 10 fields including symbol, quantity, current price, and market value
    - **Trades** (brokerage) — 12 fields including trade date, symbol, type, quantity, and price

    See the [destinations](/destinations) page for the full field reference.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start syncing">
    Click **Create Sync** to finish setup. Your first sync runs automatically, and new data is synced on an ongoing basis from there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After setup

Use the sidebar to manage your [syncs](/syncs), [connections](/connections), [destinations](/destinations), [runs](/runs), and [consents](/consents). You can trigger a manual sync anytime from a sync's detail page using the **Sync Now** button.
