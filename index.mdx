## Set up your first sync

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your bank">
    Click **Add Connection** to open the Fiskil consent flow. Select your bank and log in. Your credentials are handled securely through Australia's Consumer Data Right — they are never stored on our servers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an account">
    Once connected, your accounts sync automatically. Choose the account you want to sync — you'll see the account name, type, masked number, and current balance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a destination">
    Click **Add Destination** and choose where to send your transactions:

    - **[Google Sheets](/google-sheets)** — sync to a spreadsheet
    - **[Airtable](/airtable)** — sync to an Airtable base
    - **[Notion](/notion)** — sync to a Notion database

    Sign in with your account to grant Redbark Sync access, then select the specific spreadsheet, base, or database to write to.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review fields">
    Transactions are synced with the following fields:

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Transaction ID | Unique identifier for deduplication |
    | Date | Transaction date |
    | Description | Transaction description |
    | Amount | Transaction amount |
    | Direction | Credit or debit |

    | Category | Transaction category (if available) |

    | Account | Bank account name |
    | Status | Posted or pending |
    | Class | Payment, transfer, fee, interest, or other |
    | Post Date | Date the transaction was posted |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start syncing">
    Click **Create Sync** to finish setup. Your first sync runs automatically, and new transactions are synced daily from there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After setup

Use the sidebar to manage your syncs, connections, destinations, runs, and consents. You can trigger a manual sync anytime from a sync's detail page using the **Sync Now** button.
