## Set up your first sync

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your bank">
    Click **Add Connection** to open the Basiq consent popup. Select your bank and log in. Your credentials are handled securely by Basiq through the Consumer Data Right — they are never stored on our servers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select an account">
    Once connected, your accounts sync automatically. Choose the account you want to sync — you'll see the account name, type, masked number, and current balance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect Google Sheets">
    Sign in with your Google account to grant Redbark Sync access to your spreadsheets. Select a spreadsheet and a sheet within it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review columns">
    Transactions are written with these columns:

    | Column | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Date | Transaction date |
    | Description | Transaction description |
    | Amount | Transaction amount |
    | Balance | Account balance after transaction |
    | Category | Transaction category (if available) |
    | Account | Bank account name |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start syncing">
    Click **Create Sync** to finish setup. Your first sync runs automatically, and new transactions are synced daily from there.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After setup

Use the sidebar to manage your syncs, connections, destinations, runs, and consents. You can trigger a manual sync anytime from a sync's detail page using the **Sync Now** button.
