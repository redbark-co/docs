A connection is a link to your bank or brokerage. Each connection can include multiple accounts — for example, a transaction account and a savings account at the same bank, or several investment accounts at the same brokerage.

## Connection types

Redbark Sync supports two categories of connection:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Banking" icon="building-columns">
    Australian banks via Fiskil (CDR) and New Zealand banks via Akahu. Used for syncing transactions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Brokerage" icon="chart-line">
    Global brokerages via SnapTrade. Used for syncing holdings and trades.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Connections list

Each connection card shows:

- **Institution logo** and name
- **Account name** and masked number (e.g. •••• 1234)
- **Account type** — Transaction, Savings, Credit Card, Loan, Investment, or Term Deposit
- **Provider** — Fiskil (AU), Akahu (NZ), or SnapTrade (Brokerage)
- **Status** — connection health
- **Last synced** — when account data was last refreshed

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Connected** | Working normally |
| **Disconnected** | Credentials expired or were changed — reconnection required |

## Adding a connection

Click **Add Connection** and choose the type of account to connect:

### Australian bank

Opens the Fiskil consent flow. Select your bank, log in, and grant consent through Australia's Consumer Data Right (CDR). Your accounts sync automatically once consent is granted.

<Info>
  Australian bank connections use the Consumer Data Right framework. Your bank credentials are handled by Fiskil and are never stored on Redbark servers. CDR consents expire after 12 months — see [Consents](/consents) for details.
</Info>

### New Zealand bank

Opens the Akahu OAuth flow. Log in to your bank and authorise access. Your accounts sync automatically once the OAuth flow completes.

<Info>
  New Zealand bank connections use Akahu's OAuth authentication. Your credentials are handled by Akahu and are never stored on Redbark servers.
</Info>

### Brokerage

Opens the SnapTrade connection portal. Select your brokerage, log in, and link your account. Holdings and account details sync automatically once connected.

<Info>
  Brokerage connections use SnapTrade's secure connection flow. Your credentials are handled by SnapTrade and are never stored on Redbark servers.
</Info>

If you already have a [destination](/destinations) set up, you'll be offered the option to create a sync straight away.

## Refreshing a connection

Use the three-dot menu on an account card and select **Refresh** to pull the latest data from your bank or brokerage.

## Deleting a connection

Select **Delete** from the three-dot menu to permanently remove a connection. Any syncs using accounts from this connection will also be deleted.
