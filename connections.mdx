A connection is a link to your bank through the Consumer Data Right (CDR). Each connection can include multiple accounts — for example, a transaction account and a savings account at the same bank.

## Connections list

Each bank account card shows:

- **Institution logo** and name
- **Account name** and masked number (e.g. •••• 1234)
- **Account type** — Transaction, Savings, Credit Card, Loan, Investment, or Term Deposit
- **Status** — connection health
- **Last synced** — when account data was last refreshed

## Statuses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Connected** | Working normally |
| **Disconnected** | Credentials expired or were changed at the bank — reconnection required |
| **Pending MFA** | The bank is requesting multi-factor authentication |

## Adding a connection

Click **Add Connection** to open the Fiskil consent flow. Select your bank, log in, and grant consent. Once complete, your accounts are synced automatically.

<Info>
  Connections use Australia's Consumer Data Right framework. Your bank credentials are handled by Fiskil and are never stored on Redbark servers.

If you already have a [destination](/destinations) set up, you'll be offered the option to create a sync straight away.

## Refreshing a connection

Use the three-dot menu on an account card and select **Refresh** to pull the latest data from your bank.

## Deleting a connection

Select **Delete** from the three-dot menu to permanently remove a bank connection. Any syncs using accounts from this connection will also be deleted.
